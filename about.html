            The group formed in 1983 out of Sydney, Australia, where they were located at Hillsong Church, while now they are spread across the globe.  The group was called Hillsong Live until June 2014, when they took the name Hillsong Worship. Hillsong Worship exists to serve the global Church and equip believers everywhere with songs of Holy Spirit power that exalt and glorify the Name of Jesus, build the Church and fuel revival on the earth. With songs such as “What a Beautiful Name,” “Cornerstone,” “Mighty To Save,” “This I Believe (The Creed)” and “Who You Say I Am,” Hillsong Worships catalogue is sung by an estimated 50 million people worldwide each week. Featuring worship leaders and songwriters such as Brooke Ligertwood, Ben Fielding, Reuben Morgan, Joel Houston, Taya Gaukrodger, Aodhan King, David Ware and more, Hillsong Worship is committed to continuing its legacy of writing and leading songs that – by God’s grace – impact both individual devotion and congregational worship for the glory of God.
